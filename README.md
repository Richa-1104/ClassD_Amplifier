# ClassD_Amplifier

A simple **Class-D audio amplifier** built with **555 timer, LM358 op-amp, MOSFET, and LC filter**, designed on PCB with minimal components.

---

## Overview
Class-D amplifiers use **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** to amplify audio with very high efficiency (>90%).  
This project demonstrates how to build a basic Class-D amplifier without using any dedicated IC.
